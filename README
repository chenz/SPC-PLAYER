SPCPLAYER is a SNES SPC file player for linux and OS X.
To compile:
Linux-> make linux
OSX  -> make osx

The linux version, which was originally written in 2003, uses the old OSS methods for sound output.
That is, it essentially writes to /dev/dsp after setting up the sound system.  If it wrote it today
I would have used ALSA.  It was tested on Ubuntu 9.10 and the only bug I know of is you don't always get
a successful opening of /dev/dsp the first try.  Make sure you have zlib devel installed.

The OSX version is my first dip into Core Audio so the code isn't pretty, but it works properly.

Usage on both systems:  ./spcplayer filename.spc
