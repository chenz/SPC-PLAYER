Thank you for your interest in SOAP, or
"Steve's Own Audio Player".  My future
goal is to write a player that can
playback the many different types of
video game console sound files.
Some of these include SPC(snes), GYM(genesis),
NSF(nes) and many others.  At the moment, though,
SOAP only supports SPC playback.  My idea is to
focus on one system at a time, perfect playback,
then move onto another system. So, when I have
SPC playback rock solid, ID666 read/write implemented,
playlist support, WAV/mp3 output stable, then I will
start to implement other systems.

Enjoy!
